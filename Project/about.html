            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p id="readless">SRM AP is conducting elections in the institute. All the commities are encouraging students
                to participate in the elections to familiarize the voting system. The term vote refers to making a
                selection from a list and electing or determining something. The primary goal of elections is to elect
                representatives chosen by the voters. This online voting system aims to resolve all of the concerns. It
                should be remembered that with this system in place, the users in this situation will have plenty of
                time to vote. A voter can use his or her voting right digitally using the Online Voting Portal. Before
                he or she may vote, he or she must first register

            </p>
            <p id="readmore">
                To build this project we used web technologies (HTML,
                CSS, JS) as the front end, PHP as the middleware, and MySQL as the backend technology.
                Students who have already registered can log in directly as their credentials are verified with an
                already registered credentials list and if they match. Students who register their details will be added
                to the registered credentials list. After logging in the students will be presented with a candidates
                list and the post they are competing for. Students can then choose to vote for their preferred candidate
                and once the vote is cast they can no longer cast the same vote for different candidates for the same
                position. These voting details will be collected and accumulated for future counting where the final
                results will be displayed accordingly. All of this data will be handled by a structured table format in
                the database connected to the website.
